# Validation of the Aharonov-Bohm Effect through Measuring Total Phase Difference in a SQUID

This repository includes my advanced laboratory work on the **Aharonov-Bohm effect**, submitted as part of the PHYS 330 Advanced Laboratory course at Lawrence University. 

The study demonstrates the influence of the magnetic vector potential on superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) even in the absence of a magnetic field. By measuring the total phase difference around a superconducting loop and calculating the fundamental ratio \(e/h\) using Shapiro steps, we validate the Aharonov-Bohm effect with experimental results that align closely with theoretical predictions.

## Highlights
- **Methodology**: Utilized high-temperature superconducting materials (YBCO) and non-invasive measurement techniques based on the AC Josephson Effect to confirm the Aharonov-Bohm effect.
- **Results**: Experimental results were within 95.6% of theoretical predictions for the total phase difference, confirming the effect's validity in SQUIDs.
- **Applications**: Findings have potential implications for quantum computing, particularly in optimizing quantum gate designs through electromagnetic potentials.
